    <subject>Incomplete Mod</subject>
    <body>So uh, as you may know, this mod is unfinished.
	
	Currently, the only mission available at the Rev. Hacksquad is the NSA Mission. Currently, there is only a placeholder file in the mainframe that you have to delete.
	So, yeah. Go take a look.
	
	Oh, by the way, hit the abort contract button on your way to the hub. I was too lazy to make this thing complete itself.
