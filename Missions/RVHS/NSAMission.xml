Hacknet mission descriptor file

Note: This format is pretty hacked together, and is a lot clunkier than the computer loader one.
Not changing this was part of my "No re-writes" policy for Hacknet, so some of the elements are
very strict about their ordering and case sensitivity. Be careful, and test!

<!-- 
id : the mission ID - this isn't used in-code but is sometimes useful in debugging and testing.

activeCheck : if this is set to true, when this mission is active, Hacknet will test for this mission being complete
              every frame, instead of only when the player responds to an email. This is very useful for creating delays,
              and for situations where the player is contacted from outside an existing chain.
              
shouldIgnoreSenderVerification : This prevents the check to ensure that the player responded to the right sender
                                 when checking for mission completion.

    <!-- The sender field is very important for branching or silent mission chains. Even if this file you're editing isn't the
    email on the server the player will be responding to, it will still run it's completion checks as long as the player is responding to
    any email from the same sender. This doesn't affect basic and normal missions, so if you're not doing anything too fancy,
    don't worry about it.-->

    <body>This mission's gonna need some explaining.
	
	Our client is a anti government surveillance activist who wants the NSA off his back. Yes, the NSA.
	
	Now, we would just hack the darn thing open, but it has a whitelist.
	Your best bet is trying to find a way around the whitelist, by checking out their network. Here is a link to their website and mainframe.

Good luck,
