    <body>#PLAYERNAME#,
	
	We are, quite frankly, annoyed as hell by your activities. You know. Related to a certain alphabet soup agency.
	We will be giving you one chance and ONLY ONE to avoid prosecution.
	
	I want you to work for us. Otherwise, we're gonna head over to that hole that you call a home, AND DRAG YOU ALL THE WAY TO GUANTANAMO FUCKING BAY.
	Reply to this email with the word 'yes' to accept.
