Note: This format is pretty hacked together, and is a lot clunkier than the computer loader one.
Not changing this was part of my "No re-writes" policy for Hacknet, so some of the elements are
very strict about their ordering and case sensitivity. Be careful, and test!

id : the mission ID - this isn't used in-code but is sometimes useful in debugging and testing.

activeCheck : if this is set to true, when this mission is active, Hacknet will test for this mission being complete
              every frame, instead of only when the player responds to an email. This is very useful for creating delays,
              and for situations where the player is contacted from outside an existing chain.
              
shouldIgnoreSenderVerification : This prevents the check to ensure that the player responded to the right sender

    <!-- The sender field is very important for branching or silent mission chains. Even if this file you're editing isn't the
    email on the server the player will be responding to, it will still run it's completion checks as long as the player is responding to
    any email from the same sender. This doesn't affect basic and normal missions, so if you're not doing anything too fancy,
    don't worry about it.-->

    <body>Agent,
	
	As you may know, tensions in the Korean Peninsula are at an all time high. Before any sort of war breaks out (or the Korean armistice ends, the Korean war is technically still raging) we need intel.
	You will be hacking into their Intranet, to see if you can find anything useful. No need to decrypt or decompress anything, just upload it to the drop server.
	Their Intranet isn't actually very secure, but traces are ridiculously fast. Linked is a contact of mine who can point you to "Tracekiller" software for your mission.
	
	Good luck.
