    <body>Hello #PLAYERNAME#,
	
	This message is to confirm a recent IRC chat, where you were offered and accepted, a position in the Revolution Hacksquad.
	Before you can officially begin work however, you will need to complete a trial.
	
	Linked is a computer you will need to break into. You will have to delete a file in the home folder to complete the trial.
	Reply when you are done.
	
	Also, you might want to arm yourself at the linked asset server.
	
	- RVHS Administration
