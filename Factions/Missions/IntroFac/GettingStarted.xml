    <body>All extensions have their own folder, stored in /Hacknet/Extensions/
Create a folder with your extension name (without spaces) first. Then, copy ExtensionInfo.xml from this extension and add it to your folder.
Every folder containing an ExtensionInfo.xml file that parses properly will count as an extension.

Open up that file, and read through the descriptions. Change fields to fit your own purposes - start with the Name field up top.
Comment out fields that you don't need yet (like starting visible nodes, and factions). You can comment something out in XML by surrounding it with the triangle brackets and dashes like you see my comments doing.

Speaking of which - get yourself a good text editor that will point out XML errors for you. I recommend Sublime Text, or Notepad++. Both are free!

To get started, remove the 2 factions, the starting nodes, and the starting mission. Then change the starting theme to one of the default ones.
After that, you should be up and running!

Save this session, and try out your new empty extension.

When you decide to add some computers, make sure to add them to a folder named "Nodes" (or any subfolder within that) - the extension loader will scan that folder for all computer files and make sure they get loaded in.
Similarly, for missions, add those to a folder named "Missions" if you want them to be checked in the automated tests.

Reply here when done!
      
Side note - all of this information is available online, as something you can have open while loading in and out of your own extension more easily. Search for "Hacknet Extensions Guide".
