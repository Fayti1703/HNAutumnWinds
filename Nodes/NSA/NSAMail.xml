  Nathan,
  
  I've just been sent an alert from your cybersec guys that someone just broke into our public webserver. I need you to figure out what the hell is going on, and push this guy out of the network before he defaces the site,
  or worse, find his way into the mainframe. We CANNOT afford another leak.
  
  Fix it.
