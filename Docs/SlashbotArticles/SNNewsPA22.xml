  <posting title="The Pacific Air PA_0022 Incident">
On March 31st, 2017, Pacific Air Flight PA824 suddenly experienced flight control failure mid-flight, causing critical descent speeds and risk of crash. Control was regained shortly before critical failure and the pilots were able to recover the flight safely.
Upon thorough inspection of the aircraft upon landing, nothing wrong was discovered with the hardware of the aircraft in any sense, and the software and firmware appeared to be intact.
A full copy of the software was sent to Psylance Cyber Security to investigate for errors.

A Psylance Representative stated that they had compiled a report on the incident, however, it was tampered with and their backup was corrupted.

We will continue to report on the incident.
