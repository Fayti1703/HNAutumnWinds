  <posting title="New Opbol Dongle patent will Tantalize Fanboys">
Hardcore Opbol fans, get your affairs in order and prepare your wallets.  A new patent filed by Technological golden child Opbol Computing today suggests that the company could be moving into the home console market. The patent, for an extensible "dongle" could be a component in a new gaming system
experts say - perhaps a controller or motion sensor. As of yet, only the design - a telescoping cylinder with rounded ends - has been granted patent status, but our sources say news on the device's functionality may only be a few days away. Watch this space!
