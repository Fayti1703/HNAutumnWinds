  <posting title="New Macrosoft Phone: About as bad as you expected">
It seems Macrosoft just can't catch a break - its new "Waterfall" phone, which our staff were fortunate enough to acquire from an anonymous benefactor, has been found to have some pretty serious security flaws.

Users of the phone can expect the same buggy, last-gen OS they've grown accustomed to from the ubiquitous tech giant, but now with gaping security holes to boot - any installed apps are
able to easily gain unrestricted control of the phone, and a networking bug could lead to private data being sent unencrypted all over the net.

"Waterfall", Macrosoft's fourth generation phone is expected to launch two weeks from now, but with this discovery, experts say the launch may be delayed by up to a month. Watch this space for any future developments.
